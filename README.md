# StatisticalPlotsWithJulia

I'm teaching a course on data science at [Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University  Karlsruhe](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/en/general/about-us.html). Among other things, the course covers the topic 'data visualization', where I use the concept of the grammar of graphics (see: Leland Wilkinson, *The Grammar of Graphics*, Springer-Verlag 1999) as a theoretical foundation. 

The Julia graphics packages `Gadfly.jl` and `VegaLite.jl` are presented as two different approaches on how to implement the grammar of graphics. In this context Pluto notebooks have been created which show basic statistical plots (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots etc.) based on the aforementioned packages so that a direct comparison between them is possible.
